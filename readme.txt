del.icio.us cached++ displays a list of the latest bookmarks on a del.icio.us account, from its RSS feed, keeping the feed cached in the database.

== Description ==

del.icio.us cached++ uses the built-in MagpieRSS engine functions to create a list of the latest bookmarks on a del.icio.us account, from its RSS feed, keeping the feed cached in the database.

This plugin respects del.icio.us' ToS and will not to overload the feed with subsequent requests, since the default cache refresh period is 60 minutes.

The plugin is wigdet compatible, and allows multiple widgets with independent options.

== Installation ==

1. Download the source code
2. Extract the file `delicious_cached_pp.php` from the ZIP archive
3. Upload the file `delicious_cached_pp.php` into your Wordpress install wp-content/plugins folder
4. Activate the plugin from Wordpress administration
5. Go to *Presentation* > *Widgets*. Add the widget to the sidebar of your liking and/or setup any options you want to change.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Not anymore (since version 2.0).

= Can I display only bookmarks that belong to a given tag? =

Yes, and since version 2.0 this is made explicit. To accomplish that, go to *Presentation* > *Widgets* and fill in the optional Tag field.
